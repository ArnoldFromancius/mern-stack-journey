Summary:
I am an ambitious and versatile team player with a passion or building user-focused
products. A UX researcher at heart, I bridge the gap between product, engineering and
business, creating experiences that are as intriguing as they are usable. Apart rom work, I
blog about web technology related topics, indulge in the creation o low quality youtube
videos, and compose music.
Experience:
Freelance
Remote
Jan 2024 - Present
I have spent the last couple o months working on a range o products, all o them ullstack,
ranging rom chat bots using generative AI (AI) to AI powered products (under NDA)
•Tech: ReactJS, SolidJS, Redux, Mobx, Tailwind CSS, NodeJS, NestJS, ChatGPT Open
API, Gemini API, Google Drive API, JavaScript/Typescript, Threejs, Bunjs, ElysiaJS,
Web sockets, MongoDB, Hetzner VPS
•The rst reelance project I worked on this year was a ChatGPT powered chatbot split
into 3 main projects. The chat bot widget which uses ReactJS, Redux, and Tailwind
CSS. The client dashboard was built using ReactJS, Mobx, and Tailwind CSS. And
nally, a backend running in Nodejs using NestJS as the backend ramework, and
MongoDB or the database. I can’t mention the name o the product, because the
client wanted this to be condential. I just did what needed to be done to push the
platorm orward, adding new eatures to the project like multiple ways to train the
ChatGPT backend using dierent inputs (google drive, pd les, etc.), multiple UX
improvements on the dashboard, and additional xes and changes to the widget.
•A Gemini powered product or a large South Arican company in the ood industry
(I’m under NDA, that’s honestly all I can say). We built a prototype using raw HTML,
CSS, and JS or the rontend, and a BunJS backend using ElysiaJS or API setup and
handling.
•Sunbaked (https://sunbaked.kitanga.dev), a 3D multiplayer naval game. My current
project, ~18,000 visits/plays in the 2 week test period we had in October, currently
play testing the game on a web portal. The rontend is hosted on the platorm I am
using to playtest and on rebase hosting. The backend is setup on Hetzners’ VPS
cloud service and the server logic runs within a BunJS environment using ElysiaJS’websocket plugin (built ontop o uWebsocket) or communication between the client
and the server. The rontend uses SolidJS, custom CSS, and ThreeJS or the renderer.
The physics code is my own.
